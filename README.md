# CPP-Tutorial-Videos

This is an application which stores links to videos as well as some additional information about them. It has a GUI created with the **Qt framework**, but it can be run on the console too (which is my favorite of the two). This project is structured based on the **Model-View-Controller** pattern which can be run in admin or user mode (there are different functionalities depending on the mode chosen). The IDE I used was **CLion**.   

**Important**: Some libraries included in the project run only on Linux.
